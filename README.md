# 🎬 MovieHub - Cloud Native Microservices Architecture on AWS 🚀

**MovieHub** is a scalable **cloud-native microservices application** designed to manage **Movies** and **Users**. It offers REST APIs to:
- Retrieve all movies
- Filter movies by genre
- Manage user data (CRUD operations)

This project demonstrates **AWS architectural best practices**, including:
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Auto-Scaling
- CI/CD Pipelines
- ECS Fargate Deployments
- PostgreSQL on RDS
- S3 for object storage
- IAM Roles & Policies
- Docker-based microservices orchestration
- CloudFront CDN for global content delivery

## ✨ Key Highlights

1. 🎥 **Microservices Architecture** — Movie Service & User Service (Spring Boot)
2. 🗄️ **PostgreSQL on AWS RDS** for persistent storage
3. 🔍 **REST APIs** to fetch all movies or filter by genre
4. 🌀 **AWS ALB + Auto-Scaling** for high availability & resilience
5. 🐳 **ECS Fargate Deployment** with Dockerized Services
6. 🚀 **CI/CD Pipeline** using GitHub Actions + AWS CodeDeploy
7. 🌍 **CloudFront CDN** integration for optimized content delivery
8. 🗂️ **S3 Bucket** to store static assets (posters, trailers, etc.)
9. 🔒 **IAM Roles & Policies** for fine-grained access control
10. ⚙️ Fully automated **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** setup
